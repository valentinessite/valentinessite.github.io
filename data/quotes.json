        "quote": "Hello my love, happy valentine's day!! This may seem a little strange, so I wanted to give you a quick explanation as to what is going on here. I know we both did notes last year, and I wanted to give you something like that again so you could feel closer despite the distance. But this time, I figured I'd lean a little more into doing something unique. So here is the deal: This note will rotate daily at midnight. Over the course of a month it will move through the jar until it reaches the last message (I built in a few cool things that happen as time progresses so keep an eye out for that). Once the 14th of a month is hit, the jar will reset, going back to the first message. But don't stop coming here just because the first month ends! Every once in a while a new message will be randomly mixed in, and maybe even new features will pop up over time. I love you, and I hope that every time you come here it makes the distance feel a little smaller <3 - Caleb"
